I am tired of the heavy weight vimClojure plugin.  Slimv is heavy weight and
buggy.  Both are really cool, just too much for what I need.  I just want syntax 
highlighting and paredit.  Leiningen makes handling the rest very easy.

So here is just that, syntax and paredit.  The syntax file comes from vimClojure
with dependencies removed.  Initially, it is directly from
https://bitbucket.org/taylor_venable/metasyntax/src/tip/Config/vim/syntax/clojure.vim.
Paredit comes from slimv.  Initially it is from
https://github.com/njackson/paredit-vim

Anyway, here goes.
